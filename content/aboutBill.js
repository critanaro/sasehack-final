        The Liu Idea Lab for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (Lilie) is the home of experiential learning and co-curricular activities in entrepreneurship and innovation at Rice University. They are graciously supporting our hackathon by sponsoring a track! Their mission is to equip Rice students with both entrepreneurial skills and the entrepreneurial mindset to prepare them to be entrepreneurs and innovators in whatever industry they choose, be it a technology startup, government, civic group, non-profit, small business, or large corporation. Lilie is comprised of experiential courses, co-curricular opportunities, a state-of-the-art on-campus lab space, and an array of resources to support student learning.
